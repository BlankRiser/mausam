# Mausam

Mausam is a lightweight weather visualization tool built using the [Synoptic Data API]((https://synopticdata.com/)). It is designed to provide a quick glance at weather information, making it useful for developers or users who rely on Synoptic Data in their projects and need a simple way to visualize data.

This project is intentionally minimal and serves only as a basic interface for weather data. It should not be viewed as a replacement for the full [Synoptic Data Viewer](https://viewer.synopticdata.com/), which offers far more advanced features and analysis tools. For detailed exploration and comprehensive functionality, please use the [official Synoptic Viewer](https://viewer.synopticdata.com/).
